Visualizing the Development of Cost-of-Living in London

Welcome to our demo presentation of our visualization project on the development of cost-of-living over time in London. This project aims to uncover trends in the cost of living and provide insights into how it has evolved throughout the years.

Our visualization consists of three main components: a line chart representing the cost of living index over time, a scatter plot showing a correlation between two variables, and a stacked bar chart displaying the different categories that contribute to the cost of living.

Let's start with the line chart. Here, we can see the cost-of-living index plotted against the years. The trend line shows a clear upward direction, indicating that the cost of living in London has increased over time. This insight can help policymakers and citizens understand the overall trend in living costs and make informed decisions.

Moving on to the scatter plot, we can observe a correlation between two variables, such as housing prices and transportation costs. This visualization can help identify patterns and relationships between different factors affecting the cost of living, providing valuable insights for further analysis.

Finally, the stacked bar chart displays the different categories that contribute to the cost of living, such as housing, transportation, and groceries. By comparing the size of the bars, we can determine the relative impact of each category on the overall cost of living in London.

Our visualization project uses D3.js to create these interactive visualizations. Users can interact with the charts to explore the data further and uncover new insights. This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in understanding complex data and facilitating informed decision-making.

Thank you for watching our demo presentation. We hope you found this visualization project helpful in understanding the development of cost-of-living in London.
